## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Cluster songs based on **audio similarity**
- Visualize clusters in 3D space using **PCA**
- Impute missing genres intelligently
- Build a **text-based clustering model** using artist + genre profiles
- Recommend similar songs using **cosine similarity**
